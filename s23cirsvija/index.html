          <h1>Claude Monet</h1>  
          <p><em>Oscar-Claude Monet</em> (1840 - 1926) was a French painter and founder of Impressionism. During his long career, he was the most consistent and productive practitioner of Impressionism's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions of nature, especially in plein-air (outdoor) landscape painting.</p>
          <p>Monet was raised in Le Havre, Normandy, and showed an early interest in drawing and nature. Although his mother supported his ambition to be a painter, his father disapproved and wanted him to pursue a business career. He was very close to his mother, but she died in January 1857, and he was sent to live with his aunt. He later studied at the Académie Suisse (a Parisian art school). His early works included landscapes, seascapes, and portraits, but attracted little attention. A key influence was Eugène Boudin, one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors, who introduced him to plein-air painting. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny (northern France), where he purchased a house and began a vast landscaping project.</p>
          <p>Monet's ambition to document the French countryside led him to paint the same scene many times to capture the changing light and passing seasons. Among the best-known examples is his series of water lilies in his garden in Giverny, which occupied him continuously for the last 20 years of his life.</p>

        <p><em>Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son</em>, sometimes known as The Stroll is an oil painting created in 1875. It depicts Monet’s wife, Camille, and their son, Jean, while the family was living in Argenteuil. The painting captures a moment on a windy summer’s day, with vibrant, dynamic brushstrokes conveying movement and light—hallmarks of the Impressionist style.</p>

        <p><em>Water Lilies and the Japanese Bridge</em> represents two of Monet's greatest achievements: his Giverny gardens and the paintings they inspired. He bought a property with a brook, expanding it into a pond for his Asian water garden. He transformed the site into an inspired vision of cool greens, reflective waters, enhanced by exotic plants and a Japanese footbridge.</p>

        <p><em>Weeping Willow</em>, painted in 1918, captures the beauty of a willow tree at the edge of Monet's garden pond in Giverny. This painting is part of a larger series where Monet returned to the same tree repeatedly, reflecting his deep connection to the garden. Through these works, Monet expressed both the emotional and artistic significance the garden held for him.</p>

        <p><em>Water Lilies</em> is a series of approximately 250 oil paintings by Claude Monet, created over the last 30 years of his life. These paintings capture the serene beauty of Monet's flower garden at his home in Giverny and became his central focus during this period. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts, affecting his perception of light and color.</p> 
        <p>Here, I have selected three pieces from the Water Lilies series to showcase. To view the whole list of Water Lily paintings, visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Lilies_(Monet_series)">Water Lilies (Monet series)</a>.</p>
