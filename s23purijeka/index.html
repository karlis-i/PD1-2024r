                <p><em>Danny Brown</em>, is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from Detroit, Michigan. He was described by MTV in 2011 as "one of rap's most unique figures in recent memory"</p>
                <p>Born Daniel Dewan Sewell in Detroit on March 16, 1981. His talent for rhyming came at a very young age, 
                    as his mother would read Dr. Seuss books to him as a child, when he began to speak, he would talk in rhyme. 
                    His father was a house DJ who exposed him to all the music he would spin, as well as music from the likes of Roy Ayers, LL Cool J, Esham, and A Tribe Called Quest. 
                    For as long as he could remember, Brown had always wanted to be a rapper: "In kindergarten I'd say I wanted to be a rapper and people'd just laugh at me. 'That's a pretty funny job,' they'd say." </p>
