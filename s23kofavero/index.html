                    <p>The Twilight Forest is a mod in Minecraft created by Benimatic and ported to 1.12.2 by AtomicBlom, Drullkus, Tamaized, and williewillus. It adds the eponymous Twilight Forest as a new dimension. This dimension is a heavily forested world filled with new mobs, trees, dungeons, and bosses. This dimension's ground level is very low in response to the tall trees. The dimension is locked at sunset time, though sleeping is possible. Mobs will not spawn on the surface of the Twilight Forest, though they will spawn in dungeons and caves (EnderZoo mobs do not respect this peace).</p>
                    <p>The portal can be assembles in any shape and size you want, the image above is just the minimum size requirement and the portal can be made in many different shapes and sizes. The portal functions as long as the following conditions are met:
                    <p>1. The frame is made out of Grass, Dirt, Podzol, Mycelium, etc.</p>
                    <p>2. On top of the grass are flowers, mushrooms, leaves, plants, etc.</p>
                    <p>3. The frame must be completely filled with water.</p>

                <p>The Naga is a boss monster that can be found in the Naga Courtyard. The Naga is a large snake-like creature, and deals 9 points of damage when attacking. As the Naga sustains damage it will lose its large segments and move faster. If it is not attacked for a while it will begin to heal itself. The Naga is bound to its Courtyard and will lose interest if its targets move out of it.</p>

                <p>The Twilight Lich resides on the top of a Lich Tower. It appears as a tall skeleton wearing a purple cape, and a large golden crown. Surrounding itself is a wall of shields to protect itself from any damage, but maybe they can be broken.</p>

                <p>The Minoshroom is a mini-boss in the Twilight Forest mod in Minecraft. It found lurking in its prison at the bottom of a Labyrinth. It is a bizarre hybrid of a Mooshroom and a Minotaur.</p>

                <p>The Hydra is a three headed serpent-like dragon that can be found in a unique, cracked-open Hydra Lair in a Fire Swamp. The Hydra appears as a massive creature, with two stumpy legs supporting a wide, scaly body. Multiple serpentine necks end in heads that bear a passing resemblance to that of the Ender Dragon. The entire creature is covered in blue-green and dark blue scales.</p>

                <p>The Ur-Ghast is a boss from the Twilight Forest mod in Minecraft. It can be found flying around at the top of the gigantic Dark Tower. It appears as a large, supernatural creature with many large, waving tentacles. It is covered in what adventurers fear is blood, or could be Carminite. This creature resembles the Carminite Ghastguard, due to their ability to stalk players, as well as the Nether-exclusive Ghast, but is much larger and much more dangerous.</p>

                <p>The Snow Queen is a boss from the Twilight Forest mod in Minecraft. She is found in an ice-encrusted room near the top of the Aurora Palace. She is perhaps the most human-like creature encountered in the Twilight Forest, resembling a woman, but with large violet eyes and pale blue skin. She is immediately hostile towards any intruders in her vicinity, launching quickly into one of three main attack patterns.</p>
