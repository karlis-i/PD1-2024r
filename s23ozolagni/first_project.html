        <p><em>
            People have been useing farming tools for ages since our ancestors started farming.
        </em></p>

        <p>
            Since farming is one of my favorite hobbies, I will make a website discussing how old tools can still be used today.

        <p>
            Now, that we have mentioned some examples of tools we should see how they are used today. Most of these tools are still handheld, however some of these tools are used on a tractor whitch is a a agriculture tool as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take the plow for example there is an old version that was pulled by horses and some made to be pulled by humans, but now most plow are made to be pulled by a tractor for example this plow.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, some tools are still handheld, such as a scythe and hoe; however, there are alternatives for a tractor, such as a mower and a cultivator. These handheld tools are still used by gardeners and farmers.
Comparing the tractor version and the handheld version will not work here, since the jobs they do might be similar, but there are some differences as well such as the scythe being good for wet and long grass for smaller areas, but the mower being better for shorter drier grass. The cultivator and hoe being for similar jobs but there is also a masive difference such as the hoe being for smaller weeds between plants, but the cultivator being for large empty field to deweed.
You can see the difference bettwen the visual diffrences the tools have.
