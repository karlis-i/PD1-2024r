      <h1 class="nba">National Basketball Association</h1>
      <img class="logo" src="nba_logo.png" alt="NBA">
      <p><em>NBA </em> is a professional basketball league in North America composed of 30 teams.
        It is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier
        professional basketball league in the world.
      </p>
      <p>The NBA was created on August 3, 1949, with the merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the
        National Basketball League (NBL). The league later adopted the BAA's history and considers its founding on June
        6, 1946, as its own.
        In 1976, the NBA and the American Basketball Association (ABA) merged, adding four franchises to the NBA.
        The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball, which is recognized by the FIBA as the national governing body
        for basketball in the United States. The league's several
        international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices in Midtown Manhattan,
        while its NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current league organization divides 30 teams into two 15-team conferences of three divisions with five
        teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004-05 season. Reflecting the
        population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the
        country: 13 teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the
        Pacific.
      <p>
        The NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season and play-in tournament with the top
        eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league's championship
        title, the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a
        tiebreaker system used as needed).
