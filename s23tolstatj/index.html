            <h2> About the game</h2>
                <p class="text">Deadlock is an upcoming team-based online multiplayer third-person shooter video game developed and published by Valve. Since May 2024, Deadlock has been in early development playtesting. Players are encouraged to invite friends to test the game via Steam, but were initially told not to share details about the game publicly. In September 2024, the game reached a concurrent player count of over 170,000. Shortly after playtesting began, footage of Deadlock began to leak online and on August 12, 2024, a journalist was banned from the game's multiplayer servers after writing a preview for the technology site The Verge.[2] On August 23, 2024, Valve lifted rules on public conversation for Deadlock playtesters[3] and published a Steam store page with information about the game.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <div class="gameplay-content">
            <p class="movement_right">Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based third-person shooter combining elements of hero shooters, like Overwatch, and MOBAs, like Dota.In each match, the 12 players control unique "heroes" who begin split across four "lanes" in a large map. To win, one team has to push their "troopers" (NPCs who fight with the players) down the lanes into the opposing team's stronghold and destroy their "patron" (a large supernatural entity helping the heroes and troopers). Players can unlock various skills and abilities for their hero, as well as use ziplines to navigate the arena. The game currently has 21 different heroes, each with unique weapons, stats, and abilities. The game takes place in an alternate version of New York City sometimes referred to as the Cursed Apple, which mixes elements of 1930s prohibition era storytelling and the occult.</p>

                <p>To win a Deadlock match, you must destroy your enemies’ defensive buildings, push into their base, and kill their Patron, an extravagant brassy orb with a face. The strange voice speaking to you during the match belongs to your Patron, who you must defend at all costs (don’t worry, they won’t let you forget this). The map is horizontally symmetrical, and split into four vertical lanes that run between the enemy base and your base.</p>

                <p>Each lane is defended by a series of high-HP towers, and in each lane, a group - or ‘wave’ - of small allied NPCs called Troopers spawn periodically, travel down the lane, and attack the enemies they encounter. Killing enemy units rewards you with Souls, the main currency in Deadlock, which you can use to purchase items that make you stronger.</p>
