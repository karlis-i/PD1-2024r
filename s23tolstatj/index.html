            <h2> About the game</h2>
                <p class="text">Deadlock is an upcoming team-based online multiplayer third-person shooter video game developed and published by Valve. Since May 2024, Deadlock has been in early development playtesting. Players are encouraged to invite friends to test the game via Steam, but were initially told not to share details about the game publicly. In September 2024, the game reached a concurrent player count of over 170,000. Shortly after playtesting began, footage of Deadlock began to leak online and on August 12, 2024, a journalist was banned from the game's multiplayer servers after writing a preview for the technology site The Verge.[2] On August 23, 2024, Valve lifted rules on public conversation for Deadlock playtesters[3] and published a Steam store page with information about the game.</p>

            <div class="gameplay-content">
            <p class="movement_right">Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based third-person shooter combining elements of hero shooters, like Overwatch, and MOBAs, like Dota.In each match, the 12 players control unique "heroes" who begin split across four "lanes" in a large map. To win, one team has to push their "troopers" (NPCs who fight with the players) down the lanes into the opposing team's stronghold and destroy their "patron" (a large supernatural entity helping the heroes and troopers). Players can unlock various skills and abilities for their hero, as well as use ziplines to navigate the arena. The game currently has 21 different heroes, each with unique weapons, stats, and abilities. The game takes place in an alternate version of New York City sometimes referred to as the Cursed Apple, which mixes elements of 1930s prohibition era storytelling and the occult.</p>

                <p><b>Strength: </b> Incredible health recovery capabilities and damage mitigation from his kit. High mobility allows him to position effectively vs opponents and maximize close damage. Along with mobility, strong CC, especially in narrow spaces, make him an incredible ganker.</p>
                <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Worthless at long range if his gap closer is on cooldown. Anti-healing items and abilities really hurt him. Can struggle in wide open combat spaces vs. multiple CC and ranged heroes.</p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p><b>Strengths: </b> Among best in class for making picks. Oppressive laning phase, one of the best denyers due to left-click ease and hook pressure. Great toolset for roaming and ganking other lanes.</p>
                <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Loses a lot of threat if hook is on cooldown. Struggles against enemies with high mobility and stamina. Fighting in areas that are too open or have a lot of cover.</p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p><b>Strengths: </b> His ultimate, Singularity, offers one of the easiest engages in the game. Can AoE heal himself and allies while moving. Quantum Entanglement offers a ton of unique versatility to his team.</p>
                <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Has one of the weaker early games in terms of kill potential due to having two non-damage abilities before ult. Singularity  can get canceled by CC abilities and Items like Curse or Knockdown. Lacks burst mobility as Quantum Entanglement is slow and telegraphed.</p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p><b>Strengths: </b> With the permanent stacks of Spirit Power, Grey Talon can really snowball. Has one of the best long-range pokes in the game with Charged Shot. Immobilizing Trap makes it easy to layer CC with allies.</p>
                <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Can struggle to be useful if he falls behind. Lacks horizontal mobility, can easily get caught. Relies on ally protection in late game teamfights.</p>

                <p><b>Strengths: </b> Absolutely shreds through enemies when fed. Can safely navigate the map to scout or stalk opponents with invisibility. Smoke Bomb + Sleep Dagger is an easy-to-execute single target engage for picks.</p>
                <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Struggles if she falls behind, only utility is Sleep Dagger. Ultimate can be interrupted by items like Knockdown and Curse. Lacks mobility, Smoke Bomb isn’t the best escape against good players.</p>

                <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Anti-healing counter items. Stone Form has a long cooldown, so she has to choose her spots wisely. Needs to coordinate with allies to maximize her ult usage.</p>

            <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> No CC outside of a slow. Squishy - If you get locked down your defer damage won’t help you. Need to be close range to win the fight, so requires a delicate balance.</p>

            <p><b>Strengths: </b> Strong laning phase due to reliable poke, snare, and vantage points with Flight. Built to snowball with built-in rewards from Assassinate. Can impact nearby lanes from afar to extend lead to rest of team.</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> Lacks horizontal mobility so she’s very vulnerable when grounded. Can feel useless if she has a rough start. Limited utility with the Stake being her only crowd control.</p>

            <p><b>Weaknesses: </b> One of the more difficult characters to learn due to high skill cap. Using the Goo Ball effectively requires comfortable map knowledge. A misplaced Puddle Punch can put an ally in danger or save an enemy from death.</p>

                <p>To win a Deadlock match, you must destroy your enemies’ defensive buildings, push into their base, and kill their Patron, an extravagant brassy orb with a face. The strange voice speaking to you during the match belongs to your Patron, who you must defend at all costs (don’t worry, they won’t let you forget this). The map is horizontally symmetrical, and split into four vertical lanes that run between the enemy base and your base.</p>
                <img src="img/Deadlock-map.webp" alt="map">
                <p>Each lane is defended by a series of high-HP towers, and in each lane, a group - or ‘wave’ - of small allied NPCs called Troopers spawn periodically, travel down the lane, and attack the enemies they encounter. Killing enemy units rewards you with Souls, the main currency in Deadlock, which you can use to purchase items that make you stronger.</p>
