                <p>You Can't See Me is a catchphrase and taunt said by
                    <strong>John Cena.</strong> The line is accompanied by a gesture in
                    which Cena waves his open hand in front of his face. The catchphrase
                    is meant to indicate that Cena is too quick for his opponents to see
                    his actions coming. Online, however, jokes about the catchphrase
                    involve people joking as though they literally cannot see
                    <strong>John Cena</strong>.

                <p><em>Unexpected John Cena</em>, also known as
                    <em>"And His Name is John Cena"</em> and <em>"It's John Cena"</em>,
                    refers to video clip that loudly introduces
                    <strong>John Cena</strong> as his intro music plays. Initially, the
                    short clip is often edited onto the end of a video or Vine either to
                    produce a jumpscare or humorous effect, but as the meme grew popular
                    there have been deviations such as gifs and images that have
                    diverted from this conventional approach.

                    was later adapted as a green screen and inserted in other videos and
                    memes.

                <p><em>Confused John Cena</em> is a reaction image macro series
                    featuring a GIF of professional wrestler John Cena with a shocked
                    expression on his face. On April 7th, 2013, at Wrestlemania 29, John
                    Cena and The Rock wrestled for the WWE Championship. During the
                    match, Cena attempts to pin the Rock, but when the Rock kicks out of
                    the pin, Cena reacts with a confused expression at about 32 minutes
                    into the match.

                <p>John Cena Speaking Chinese and Eating Ice Cream refers to a video of
                    wrestler and actor John Cena recording a video of himself sitting in
                    his car with an ice cream in his hand while promoting the film Fast
                    & Furious 9. The video was parodied by YouTubers by altering the
                    English subtitles to make it appear as though Cena was in a dire
                    situation. Additionally, the video was shared in edits meant to
                    emphasize the way Cena says "ice cream" (Bing Qi Lin / 冰淇淋) in
                    Mandarin, phonetically written as "Bing Chilling."
