                        <p>The year’s surprise sensation, Alison Espach’s improbably fun novel follows the adventures of a severely bummed out young woman who finds herself accidentally crashing a lavish wedding at a posh Rhode Island inn. Readers love Espach’s twisty tonal shifts—from high drama to screwball comedy of manners—and the ultimate moral of her story: Go with the flow; who knows what might happen?</p>

Incredibly, her life gets even more complicated when she returns to a dangerously divided America. Hannah has two GCA awards on her shelf already, for 2015’s The Nightingale and 2018’s The Great Alone.</p>

                        <p>In what may be the year’s most discussed book, Jonathan Haidt provides a rigorously researched assessment of adolescent mental health in the 21st century. The depressing diagnosis: The arrival of the “phone-based childhood” is essentially rewiring the very experience of growing up. The good news: Haidt has some specific suggestions for parents, schools, tech companies, and governments.</p>
