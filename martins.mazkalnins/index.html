				<p><em>The album E by Ecco2k</em> is an outstanding cult classic adored by fans all over the world for its ethereal, otherworldly sounds and vocals. This album falls into the category of "outsider music", with it's glossy, drainy aesthetic paired with the very serious message of mental struggles of being a black man in sweden, that gets pretty dark if the listener pays close attention to the lyrics.</p>
				
				<p>This is the debut solo album released by Ecco in 2019 and so far it's the only one he has put out, whilst fans can't get enough of it Ecco is keeping radio silence about his upcoming releases, most likely focusing on perfecting his art.</p>
				
				<p>The album E, could be considered a self titled, the tracklist consists of 12 officially released songs that are the following</p>

Ecco knows this and leans into the persona in many ways, such as his style and mannerisms</p>
